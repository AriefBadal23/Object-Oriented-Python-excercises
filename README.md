##  Object-Oriented-Python-excercises

Some Object Oriented Programming exercises from the book I have read *"Object-Oriented Python
Master OOP by Building Games and GUIs"* by Irv Kalb.

These excercises helped me more to understand the 4 Pilars of OOP:
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Inheritence
- Encapsulation

By creating games with the Python library *Pygame* and Gui's with pyGui.
